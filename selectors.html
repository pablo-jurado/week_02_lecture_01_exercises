    <h2>Mashed Potatoes and Gravy</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>For Mashed Potatoes:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water for 15 to 20 minutes, until very tender.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the butter and half-and-half in a small saucepan.</li>
            <li>Drain the potatoes.</li>
            <li>While still hot, place the potatoes in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.</li>
            <li>With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the hot half-and-half mixture, the sour cream, 2 teaspoons salt, and the pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix until the potatoes are mashed but not completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with gravy on the side.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For Gravy:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large (10- to 12-inch) saut√© pan, cook the butter and onions on medium-low heat for 12 to 15 minutes, until the onions are lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Don't rush this step; it makes all the difference when the onions are well cooked.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flour into the pan, whisk in, then add the salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the hot chicken stock and Cognac, and cook uncovered for 4 to 5 minutes, until thickened.</li>
            <li>Add the cream, if desired, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
